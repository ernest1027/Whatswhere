~~We highly recommend you try out our site. This is not just a series of UI mockups as some projects are, you can play around with our app this minute. We are not just another project submitted to a dozen other hackathons on the off chance you take interest.~~

WhatsWhere seeks to enable its users to minimize their contact with others while shopping for essentials. All too often we have gone to stores for a product on sale only to find that it is out of stock and even if you were willing to pay for convenience now need to drive to another store and expose yourself to a whole new set of people. This is obviously inconvenient but in the times we live in, it could even be deadly. 

The app simplifies grocery shopping by consolidating your shopping list to the fewest stores possible. This is accomplished through crowdsourced data that our users provide as a community in the demo, but this could just as easily leverage the inventory systems of stores that partner with us.

WhatsWhere also provides us insight into local consumer spending habits that could potentially be used to better target other food-related products and services to communities. This data could very well become more valuable than the alternative monetization option of promoted stores.

Sean makes --but just as often breaks-- things in his tech projects. He loves to work with the parts of projects users don't see: infastructure, backends, and hardware that powers large projects.

# WhatsWhere

WhatsWhere seeks to enable its users to minimize their contact with others while shopping for essentials. All too often we have gone to stores for a product on sale only to find that it is out of stock and even if you were willing to pay for convenience now need to drive to another store and expose yourself to a whole new set of people. This is obviously inconvenient but in the times we live in, it could even be deadly. 

WhatsWhere also provides us insight into local consumer spending habits that could potentially be used to better target other food-related products and services to communities. This data could very well become more valuable than the alternative monetization option of promoted stores.
